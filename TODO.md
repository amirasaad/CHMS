# TODO List
- [x]  An ERD diagram describes the DB design, field types, relationships, constraints, etc. ( a screenshot on your repo is fine)

- [x] SQL which implements above ERD. (MySQL)

- [x] A Python microservice implemented using Flask microframework that should connect to MySQL DB and have the following endpoints:
